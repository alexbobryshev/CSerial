# CSerial

Cross-platform serial port implementation.

[Homepage](http://programming.rm5248.com/projects/c-serial/)

Based largely off of [JavaSerial](https://github.com/rm5248/JavaSerial),
CSerial aims to bring cross-platform serial programming to a computer near you.

The library is structured along the lines of the Apache Portable Runtime(APR).
It aims to provide as much low-level support as is required to create a working
serial port implementation.

For information on how to use the library, check out the example program
under the 'examples' directory.

Questions?  Bugs?  Open an [issue](https://github.com/rm5248/CSerial/issues)
 in GitHub and I will take a look at it.
